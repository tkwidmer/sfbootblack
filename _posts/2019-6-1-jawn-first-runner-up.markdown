Current Mr SF Leather Jawn Marques, took home first runner up out of 68 contestants this year at IML. The 41st IML title ended up going to Jawn's Bare Chest Calendar brother Jack Thompson. Jawn delivered a passionate speech about losing his husband TJ to suicide in the summer of 2018. This message reached many people on the IML stage. Jawn easily made top 20 this year giving him the opportunity to deliver his speech.

Also of note: Amp Somers who was 1st runner up at Mr SF Leather in 2019 also placed in the top twenty at IML. He placed 5th place in the competition overall. It was a great year for San Francisco at the IML contest this year.
