The San Francisco Leather Alliance Weekend is set for 2019 and once again the San Francisco Bootblack contest will be a part of the festivities. The dates have been set for March 1-3, 2019 in San Francisco, CA at the beautiful SOMA Arts venue.

The second annual bootblack contest will be held as part of the weekend. In similar fashion to last year, the contest will be held partially on Friday night March 1st concluding in the final contest night on Saturday March 2nd.

We will welcome Victoria, the first San Francisco Bootblack back to our stage to stepdown on Saturday night, and we will see who will carry on the stole for the second year of the SF Bootblack Title. Victoria has had a wonderful year. She has not only been out in our local community, but has been seen at events on both the west coast and the midwest. The SF Bootblack stole made it out to IML in it's first year. We are very proud of the work she has done to raise visibility for this title in its first year.
