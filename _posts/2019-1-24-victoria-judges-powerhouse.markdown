Current San Francisco Bootblack, Victoria judged the 2019 Mr Powerhouse Leather contest held in January at the Powerhouse bar in San Francisco. Victoria became the first woman to judge that contest in the 22 year history of that title.

As Victoria's year draws to a close, we want to take a moment to just honor what a year it's been for her as the first San Francisco Bootblack. She has taken the stole to both International Ms Leather and Bootblack contests in San Jose as well as to the International Mr Leather and Bootblack contests in Chicago. We are so proud of Victoria and all the work she has done this year.
