    bio: |
      Ms. V, International Ms. Bootblack 2007 was the first woman of color to
      win that title. She has been a Bootblack for well over 12 years. She is a
      native of the San Francisco Bay Area. An active member of the San Francisco
      Leather Community, she has done extensive fundraising and has been groomed
      and mentored, Leather titleholders both locally and nationally. She is a
      graduate of the Journeyman 3 Academy, a member of the Exiles, a member of
      Mama's Family, a former member of the Leather Forum and she currently serves
      on the board for the IMSL Foundation. She was an original member of the
      SF Bootblack Studio, later known as the NorCal Bootblacks. She was responsible
      for bringing back the International Sir/boy, California Community Bootblack
      Title back to Northern California. As the first woman to bootblack in
      Leather bars in San Francisco, she was determined to seek more opportunities
      for both female identified Bootblacks and for Bootblacks of color to apply
      their craft. By breaking down barriers, Ms.V has paved the way for many other
      Bootblacks. She became the resident Bootblack for both the Powerhouse, and
      Chaps II/Kok Bars. She enjoyed a long tenure as the Bootblack to the former
      SF Stompers Boots store, servicing and restoring hundreds of boots. She presently
      co-hosts the Queer Leather Happy Hour and continues to foster community in
      Leather. She is spiritual in her Leather journey. To her, Bootblacking is
      religion. It is a deep and soul satisfying process which is an expression
      of love and joyful devotion to her community and her people, which requires
      dedication. Her journey has taken her from trying to shine and perfect every
      boot to finding beauty in imperfection. Her process is simple, slow, and
      uncluttered and it reveres the authenticity of the boot above all.  It’s
      about honoring the intrinsic beauty and function of that boot, appreciating
      all of its imperfection, impermanence, and incompleteness.  Simplicity,
      economy, austerity, modesty, intimacy, sensuality and appreciation. She
      continues to preserve the tradition of "honoring stories" by supporting
      the next generation of bootblacks and by spreading the gospel of boots.
      She is spiritual in her Leather journey and she shines in her artful Leather care.
