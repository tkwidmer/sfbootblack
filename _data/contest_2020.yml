  ub:
    name: "Unicorn Boy"
    bio: |
      Unicorn boy, or U.b., is a bootblack - bootslut - leather boy - with a penchant for all things service. U.b. can be found volunteering for virtually any event they show up to, bootblacking on the back patio of the SF Eagle, or caught in some compromising position in a dirty back alley of SOMA. His drive to grope as much leather as possible within his lifetime has led to his passion and number one perversion being boots. Whether it be projects at home, at a stand in a bar, alongside a rockstar lineup of bootblacks at Folsom, birthing a bevy of baby bootblacks from his leathery loins, or licking his Sir’s boots clean after having come on them.... boots breathe life into this Unicorn, and bootblacking is the most joyous way for them to love on the community that he finds a home in.

      of the San Francisco Bay Area, home to his chosen family.

      Currently Mr. SF Eagle Leather, Manny began his adult local community service
      with the 2018 Bare Chest Calendar benefitting Positive Resource Center. As an
