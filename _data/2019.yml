    bio: |
      Pawlish, International Mr. Bootblack 2017, is passionate about learning and mentorship—fostered by his years at a particularly "fruity" company. After 18 moves across 3 continents, what he’s learned is to stay hungry, and working in IT for an Bay Area startup fits that bill… for now. That hunger also persists when it comes to Leather & kink, where he loves discussing social impact and challenging others’ perspectives. He’s found resonance with puppy play, bootblacking, and Sir/Daddy roles. Navy, red, and houndstooth, all on the left, are his favorite hankies, but don’t be afraid to ask about others! You can find him wagging away while putting a shine to a boot, snacking on whatever he’s recently baked. Pawlish lives in Cincinnati with his husband, Bamm-Bamm.
