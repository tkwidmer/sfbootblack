    Teagan fell in love with bootblacking at a young age, doing her shoes before church. Although these days her skills are being put to more salacious uses, she still identifies as a spiritual bootblack. For her, bootblacking harkens back to the foot-washing ritual. Teagan is International Ms Bootblack 2018, and the 20th person to hold that title. She is based in Oakland, CA. During her title year she invited our community to "Take Refuge" in the capable hands of our bootblacks. She's the executive producer of the San Francisco Bootblack Contest.

    As a 15+ year kinkster, Spencer took his proclivities for leather and play public (beyond Up Your Alley/Folsom and the occasional play party) in search for other areas of intersecting communities to serve as an activist and service leader within. It was over the past year where he served as Mr Powerhouse Leather 2018 that we really got to know him much more closely. Spencer's signature events at San Francisco's historic cruising bar have included a nod to his primary flagging color, 'Beige' the handshake as he calls it, along with 'Flagging' and most recently and current, STANK--a ripe pit fetish party that has been in function for 7+ years. Under Spencer's production, STANK has finalized agreements to launch in Los Angeles at the start of 2019! Building yet another path of shared experience between our two communities. He's raised funds, awareness and dialogue throughout his year for various non-profits and efforts ranging from the Aids Life Cycle, the San Francisco Bay Area Leather Alliance, various trans youth POC projects, and funding for his successor to expand Powerhouse's visibility across partner communities--to name a few. Since their experience competing for Mr San Francisco Leather, Spencer has also joined the San Francisco Band of Brothers leather men group, where he's been a vocal driving force in building on the organization's commitment to fostering brotherhood, mentorship, and activism. While he's spent much of the past year diving deeper into the many sides of impact and bondage play, his interest are wide. Ask him for a story!.
