  name: Victoria Bootblack
  bio: |
    Victoria is a mouthy, unapologetically black, and highly-opinionated baby bootblack. Though fairly new to the leather community, she is long acquainted with general deviance and prurient behavior. Hobbies include: talking shit at the bootblack stand at SF Eagle, shouting into the void about racial injustice and/or the patriarchy, and forcing people to participate in lap-dance contests. She is an active member of a whole bunch of Leather organizations including SF girls of Leather and SF Bay Area Bootlab, for whom she organizes a monthly community event.

  bio: |
    Queer High Femme. Leather babygirl. Bootblack.

    She is a proud patched member of the San Francisco girls of Leather, Bay Area raised, total cutie-pie with curves for days.  And don't forget those femme flags: hunter green, tan, and floral on the Right.

    She has been getting her handâ€™s dirty as a bootblack in the community since 2013. She started her training with Scout the Bootblack and is currently being mentored under Ms. V. With an attention to detail and grease under her nails, nothing phases this Bootblack.
