  bio: |
    Victoria is a mouthy, unapologetically black, and highly-opinionated baby bootblack. Though fairly new to the leather community, she is long acquainted with general deviance and prurient behavior. Hobbies include: talking shit at the bootblack stand at SF Eagle, shouting into the void about racial injustice and/or the patriarchy, and forcing people to participate in lap-dance contests. She is an active member of a whole bunch of Leather organizations including SF girls of Leather and SF Bay Area Bootlab, for whom she organizes a monthly community event.
