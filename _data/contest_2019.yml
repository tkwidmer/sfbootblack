    name: "Pawlish"
    title: "International Mr Bootblack 2017"
    position: "Bootblack Judge"
    bio: |
      Pawlish, International Mr. Bootblack 2017, is passionate about learning and mentorship—fostered by his years at a particularly "fruity" company. After 18 moves across 3 continents, what he’s learned is to stay hungry, and working in IT for an Bay Area startup fits that bill… for now. That hunger also persists when it comes to Leather & kink, where he loves discussing social impact and challenging others’ perspectives. He’s found resonance with puppy play, bootblacking, and Sir/Daddy roles. Navy, red, and houndstooth, all on the left, are his favorite hankies, but don’t be afraid to ask about others! You can find him wagging away while putting a shine to a boot, snacking on whatever he’s recently baked. Pawlish is Sir to Pup.Gadget and lives in Cincinnati with his husband, Bamm-Bamm.

  marlene:
    name: "Marlene"
    title: "Board President CSC"
    position: "Community Bootblack Judge"
    bio: |
      Marlene Hoeber is board president of The Center for Sex and Culture, a long-time member of various leather communities, a queer history nerd, and somebody’s mom. In 1991, she co-founded a college campus-based student leather organization and began her life-long love of making information about sexuality available to people who need it. For Marlene, sexual liberation is integral to her notions of revolutionary politics, coming close to the need to keep people fed and clothed and housed. She loves to tinker with things (both literally and metaphorically) and makes her living as an engineer, designing and building laboratory equipment for scientists. Feed her a couple of drinks in the right company, and you can get her Philadelphia accent to come back as strong as it was when she was a kid.

    head_judge: true
    bio: |
      Bamm-Bamm identifies as a switchy sexual opportunist, and bootblacking is no exception. Whether he’s grinding on a pair of Wesco’s at the nearest leather bar, or has his head up a kilt at a conference, or greasing the boots standing on his chest at any given moment, it’s all about the erotic energy exchange. Known for his hyper-sexual Bootblacking style, whether top or bottom, Bamm knows how to ensure everyone in his chair leaves satisfied. Bamm-Bamm is one of very few people to have held two major international leather titles, having won International Leatherboy in 2012 and International Mr. Bootblack 2015.

      You can now find him groping every pair of boots in sight whenever he gets the opportunity to bootblack, as well as teaching classes at events around the world and perverting everyone willing along the way. He currently calls Cincinnati home with his husband & fellow IMBB, Pup Pawlish, and is also celebrating 6 years as the proud handler of the infamous pup Tugger.

    position: "Mr SF Leather Judge"
    bio: |
      I'm Annie. I'm part of Ye Olde Middle-Aged Guard. Lol. I like to play all sorts of ways. I've played a whole lot with my boy and some others. I've taught a couple of classes over the years and been around the block a few times. I've been active in the public scene for more than 15 years. I'm queer. I'm fae. I am active in the planning process for my community group. I'm friendly and like meeting all sorts of folks. I try to live somewhat gently and love a whole lot. I want to live my life so that the Westborough Baptist Church will protest at my funeral. In my professional life, I am seasoned to the point of being salty. My hobbies, besides play, are writing and photography. I love music and art. I'm fluent in Spanish and always curious about cultures different than mine. I believe in working towards a better world. Our community has the power to change the world because when we play, we travel between the worlds and what is between the worlds can change the worlds. That's why I am excited to be a part of Mr. SF Leather and see the role these events play in bringing us together. And like the children's song goes, "The more we get together, the happier we'll be".

  erick:
    name: "Erick Lopez"
    title: "Former Mr SF Leather Den Daddy"
    position: "Mr SF Leather Judge"
    bio: |
      Erick has volunteered for the Imperial Court for many years and has held various titles with the Ducal Court, including Royal Daddy 2015. He was part of the original 6 founding members of the YLDG, has done the Leather walk for the past 7 years, and has volunteered for Real Bad, Magnitude and various booths at Folsom Street Fair. He has written articles for Instigator Magazine (an Alpha Male fetish magazine) and for the past 5.5 years has been producing CODE at The Edge, which focuses on bringing leather and gear back to the Castro.

      Mr. Lopez first started in the SF Leather contest scene as den boy back in 2011. After three years as den boy, he became Den Daddy where he stayed for another 4 years, for a total of 7 years in the den. After his first year in the den, learning how contests run, and working at The Edge Bar, he decided to revive the Mr. Edge Leather title which had taken a 4 year hiatus; he then continued producing that contest for 6 years. Erick has also taken part in helping start other titles such as Mr. Sober Leather & Mr. Chaps Leather, and has been den staff to other titles such as Mr. Daddy’s Barbershop Leather and Mr. Bolt Leather in Sacramento.

      Last year he stepped up to a new role for the SF contest as the liaison between feeder contests producers and city contest producers. Contrary to popular belief, Erick has never held a leather title and likes to be a prime example that you don’t need one to do great community work.
