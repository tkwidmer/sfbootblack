### Accessible Event

It’s important to the Leather Alliance that the weekend be as accessible as possible in many ways.


### Wheelchair accessibility

All our event locations are wheelchair accessible, including the main floor of SF Catalyst.



### ASL interpreters

All parts of the weekend will have an ASL interpreter on hand. If you need one for the Show and Tell on Saturday afternoon, please let us know so we’re sure to have you covered there too.



### Mobility

We will have seating set aside for those that need that space. If you know you’ll need that and haven’t let Angel Garfold know that already, please reach out so we’re sure to have enough space.

### Affordability

We don’t want lack of funds to be a barrier to anyone participating in the event. Tickets to our awards event are as low as $10.  Scholarship tickets are available.  Email lawscholarships@leatheralliance.org with your request.

If you’d like to help make sure everyone can join in with a donation, you can donate when you buy your ticket, or PayPal a donation through leatheralliance.org.


### Sober friends

We will have soda for sale. The sales of alcohol will be in the same room but at a different station. Free water is available to all via dispensers.



### Food
If you’re attending the dinner Friday night, all the foods will be marked with a list of ingredients. No alcohol will be used. Dressings will be on the side. Vegetarian dishes will available as well.



### Fragrance sensitivity
We ask our attendees to keep in mind those that have sensitivity to fragrances.


### Did we forget anything?

Have we forgotten something or have ideas on how we can improve?
Please let us know!  We look forward to seeing you there!
