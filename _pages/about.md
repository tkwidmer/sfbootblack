for further titles.

## History

The San Francisco Bootblack contest was started by the SF Bay Area Leather Alliance
to contribute to the growth of the Leather Alliance Weekend. Local bootblack and Southwest
Bootblack 2017 petitioned the board to add the title with a proposal during a
board meeting in June of 2017.
