    <h2> About the Contest </h2>

    <p>
    The SFBB title is the first bootblack title to represent the Northern California region since
    the Northern California Community Bootblack title shut down after Scout was it's last
    titleholder in 2013.
    </p>

    <p>
    The SFBB Contest is designed to blend some of the components of both the IMBB title
    and the IMsBB title, in order to help prepare contestants should they choose to compete
    for further titles.
    </p>

    <h2> History </h2>
    <p>
      The San Francisco Bootblack contest was started by the SF Bay Area Leather Alliance
      to contribute to the growth of the Leather Alliance Weekend. Local bay area bootblack
      and Southwest Bootblack 2017 Teagan petitioned the board to add the title with a
      proposal during a board meeting in June of 2017. The board unanimously moved to
      add a bootblack contest.
